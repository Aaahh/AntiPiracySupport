# AntiPiracySupport

Report new piracy markets and malware to me or get help us out by getting involved.
For ROM developers interested in this it makes more sense to track this project directly 
and then bridge into an existing package with system perms (settings) so any changes made 
here to the blacklisted packages or improvements will reach out to everyone. feel free to fork as well.

Thank you for helping to support developers/themers by making it more difficult to steal from them!
